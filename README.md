This project compares the performance of various classification algorithms — including Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and a Neural Network — on a airline customers satisfaction detection dataset comprising over 103k consumers and 24 features. The goal is to evaluate and contrast the effectiveness of these models.

**Key Features:**
- Dataset: 1.2M+ rows, 23 features (including class imbalance typical of fraud detection)
- Models Compared: Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Neural Network
- Metrics Used: Accuracy, Model_Run_Time
